.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility opens 
.Ar item
in a way that is specified in configuration file.
Typically,
.Ar item
is a file or URI, but can be any string.
.Pp
A configuration file consists of a set of patterns and associated actions.
The utility searches configuration file for the first pattern that mathes the
.Ar item .
The action is executed using sh(1) in the same process or in the child,
if
.Fl c
option is specified.
If no pattern is found, the utility
exits with error code 2.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Execute matched action in a child process.
If the pattern is found, the parent process will immediately exit with code 0.
.It Fl f Ar conigfile
Specifies the configuration file.
The default one is
.Pa $HOME/.regopen .
.El
.Sh CONFIGURATION FILE
A configuration file consists of patterns and associated actions.
.Pp
Pattern comes in a form of extended regular expression that occupies
exactly one line.
See
.Xr re_format 7
for information on regular expressions.
The first action after the pattern is associated with
this pattern.
.Pp
Action consists of one or more lines prefixed with tab character.
Those lines will be passed to sh(1), with environment variable
.Em item
set to the specified
.Ar item .
Action is separated from the next pattern by empty line.
.Pp
Any line that starts with the
.Ql #
character is ignored.
.Pp
Example:
.Bd -literal
